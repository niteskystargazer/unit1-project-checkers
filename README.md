<h2 align="center">Created by Bradley Motsinger</h2>
<br />
<p>I created this in browser checkers game as a means to push myself. I am relatively new to coding and I want to push myself to learn as much as possible as quickly as possibe. I have spent 34 years of my life working a career that never really called to me. However coding has always been a passion of mine and it would call me back to dabble with it many times over the years since I was 15 years old. Honestly when I was first tasked with doing this project I only had an very vague of how I would implement the rules and mechanics of the game and, even less so, how i would enforce those mechanics with code. If you are interested in seeing my initial thoughts and ideas of the project were checkout <a src="psuedo.txt">My Plans</a>.</p>
<br />
<h3>GAME RULES</h3>
<p>
  Now the rules of the game are simple!
  <ol>
    <li>You can only move pieces diagonally</li>
    <li>All piece can only move one direction</li>
    <li>The exception are kings that are able to move up or down</li>
    <li>The winner is determined by who has captured more opposing pieces</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<br />
<h3>PLANS FOR THE FUTURE</h1>
<p>
  My biggest plans for the project are to learn how to play the game with others. I currently do not have the knowledge to create or program something that utilizes things like backend programing or web sockets. However once i gain the knowledge I would love to create and play more games with my friends and family online, so that my small works can share a bit of joy with those i care about.
